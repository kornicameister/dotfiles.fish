# dotfiles.fish

kornicameister's üêü shell configuration.

## Disclaimer

This configuration is primarily used in my own [dotfiles](https://github.com/kornicameister/dotfiles).
I have extracted it from there to avoid mixing shell configuration and system packages.
That was, I believe, one of the mistakes I have made when configuring **zsh**.

## How to use

### Install

Just follow the instruction [here](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell#getting-fish)

### Clone the repo

Clone this repo in correct location.
In most of the cases I think this will `$HOME/.config/fish`.

### Check it out

To verify if you like it just launch üêü via `fish` in your terminal

### Don't like it?

Just remove cloned repo with `rm -rf $HOME/.config/fish`
